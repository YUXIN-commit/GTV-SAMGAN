**GTV-SAMGAN Integrating GTV-MFIT and Generative Adversarial Networks in SAM-med2d for Lung Cancer GTV Segmentation**

We would like to thank [SAM-Med2D](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/SAM-Med2D/tree/main); our code is based on theirs with modifications.

**Datasets**

In this study, we utilized two lung cancer datasets.

1. Public Dataset

   The public dataset was obtained from the[NSCLC-Radiomics Dataset](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/nsclc-radiomics/)ï¼Œwhich contains images from 422 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2. Local Dataset

    The local dataset is a clinical dataset collected from a local hospital, comprising 112 lung cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. The median age of the patients was 64 years, with an age range of 40 to 89 years. This dataset is confidential and not publicly available.

**Usage**

This code has been implemented in python language using Pytorch library and tested in ubuntu OS, though should be compatible with related environment.

**Installation**

Run the following code to install the Requirements:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
